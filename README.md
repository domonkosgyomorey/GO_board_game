# Description
[GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) ) (Not the language! :) ) a very complicated board game with very simple rules, like a chess

I always like the chess like games and who is also like it, she/he will be like GO too.
In fact I created my own real GO table at home.

And the relatively hard thing about it... to implement it rules.
So this project is kinda a challenge for me too.
