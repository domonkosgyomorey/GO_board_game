# Description
[GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) ) (Not the language! :) ) a very complicated board game with very simple rules, like the Chess

I always like the Chess like games and who is also like it, she/he will be like GO too.<br>
In fact I created my own real GO table at home.<br>
<br>
And the relatively hard thing about it... to implement it rules.<br>
So this project is kinda a challenge for me too.<br>

## Build and run
```console
./build.sh
./go

```

## How to play?
you need to type your next move in an algebric notation.<br>
The '.' is the empty cell<br>
    'O' is the white cell<br>
    '#' is the black cell<br>
example:<br>
The board:<br>
a .....<br>
b .....<br>
c .....<br>
d .....<br>
e .....<br>
  01234<br>
An input: c2<br>
will cause -> <br>
a .....<br>
b .....<br>
c ..O..<br>
d .....<br>
e .....<br>
  01234<br>
