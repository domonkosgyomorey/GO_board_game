# Description
[GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) ) (Not the language! :) ) a very complicated board game with very simple rules, like a chess

I always like the chess like games and who is also like it, she/he will be like GO too.
In fact I created my own real GO table at home.

And the relatively hard thing about it... to implement it rules.
So this project is kinda a challenge for me too.

## Build and run
```console
./build.sh
./go

```

## How to play?
you need to type your next move in an algebric notation.
The '.' is the empty cell
    'O' is the white cell
    '#' is the black cell
example:
The board:
a .....
b .....
c .....
d .....
e .....
  01234
An input: c2
will cause -> 
a .....
b .....
c ..O..
d .....
e .....
  01234

## Dependencies
- gcc
- shell
